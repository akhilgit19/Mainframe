1. INTRODUCTION TO JCL
2. JCL PARAMETERS
		1. JOB
		2. EXEC	--	PGM ,PROC , PARM , TIME , REGION , COND***
		3. DD 		DSN,DISP,SPACE,UNIT,VOL=SER,LREFCL,RECFM,BLKSZIE
3. JCL UTILITES (PRE-CODED PGM)
4. JCL GDG CONCEPT
5. JCL PROC'S
6. JCL ABEND ->  S322 , S822..

JCL CLASS 01:
======================================================================================

JCL  - JOB CONTROL LANG

	JOB -> MEANS EXECUTION OF 1 OR MORE PGMS
		EACH PGM EXEC IS KNOW AS A STEP

JOB -> STEPS

	1. JOB STATMENT
	2. EXEC 
	3. DD
	4. NULL 

JOB STATMENTS;	USED TO TELL THE JOB NAME AND JOB EXECUTION SETUP PARAMETER..

	//JOBNAME   JOB  NOTIFY=&SYSUID

JCL PARAMETER'S:

	2 TYPES		1. POSITIONAL PARAMETERS	- THE PARAMETER VALUE IS IDENFIFED BY THE SYSTEM BY PLACE OF THE VALUE 
			2. KEY WORD PARAMETERS		- IT JCL DEFINED WORD

		ON A JOB STATMENT WE HAVE 2 POSITIONAL PARAMETERS

			1. ACCOUNTING-INFRO		== USED TO TRACK THE RESOURCE UNTILIZATION..

				//JOBNMAE  JOB (098902,98902),
				//JOBNAME  JOB 98902
				//JOBNAME  JOB (0903,2NSJS,28902),


			2. PRORAMMER DESCRIPTION:	COMMENT/DETAILS PROCESS OF THE JOB - 20 CHARACTER

				//JOBNAME  JOB (08902,09),'TEST JOB'


	KEY WORD PARAMETERS:

		1. NOTIFY=&SYSUID		> USED TO GET THE JOB COMPLETION NOTIFICATION FROM THE JES SYSTEM..
					WE DONOT USE THIS IN PROD JOB'S

		2. CLASS=A/B/1/2	- ADMIN PROVIDED VALUE (COPY -PASTE)

			USED TO ALLOCATE THE REQUIRED RESOURCE FOR A JOB TO RUN?

			1. WHICH CPU?
			2. HOW LONG - TIME LIMIT
			3. REGION SPACE
			4. PRTY
			5. OTHERS

		3. TIME & REGION
			TIME=(MM,SS) == THIS IS USED TO INCREASE THE TIME FOR A GIVE JOB

				IN MY APPLICATION 100 JOB -> CLASS=X -> CPUX , CPU TIME LMIT => 5MIN FOR EACH JOB , REGION SPACE = 3MB

				90JOB - R ABLE TO COMPLETE WITHIN 5MIN
			 	10 JOB -> WHICH NEED MORE TIME (MORE STEPS , MORE DATA)
					BUT WHEN ANY JOB EXCEED THE TIME LIMIT --> ABEND	S322 => CPU TIME OUT ABEND

				S322 - CPU TIME OUT ABEND -> SOLUTION IS TO INCRASE THE TIME AND RERUN..
				HOW MUCH TIME I NEED TO INCREASE?
					
				>> JOB ABEND -> LOG -> 

					START TIME	- ABEND-TIME
					10AM			10.10AM	=	> 10 MIN TIME LIMIT
						10 *2 -> TIME=20 => RERUN	==> 95% IT WIL BE SUCCESSFULL
				 5% WHEN IT FAIL AGAIN WITH SAME S322??

					1. SYSTEM	- IS THE SYSTEM IS SLOW  (1 MIN - 1000 RECORDS , 1 MIN = 10 RECORDS)
								TIME=1440 (24 HR) - MONITOR THE RUN TILL IT COMPLETES
						
					2. DATA		- WHAT WAS THE DATA COUNT YESTERDAY** AND WHAT COUNT INPUT U GOT TODAY

							5000(YESTERDAY) , 20000 (TODAY) --> CHECK BACK AND SEE WHY WE HAVE SO MUCH OF DATA
							5000 (YESTERDAY) , 6000 (TODAY) --> NO ISSUE
					3. PROGRAM IN THE LOOP**
					



			REGION=XM  == THIS IS USED TO INCREASE THE REGION SPACE FOR A GIVE JOB
			
				90 JOB -> R ABLE TO COMPLETE WITH 2MB SPACE. REGION
				10 JOB -> WHICH NEED MORE REGION SPACE (MORE STEP , MORE DATA)

					ANY JOB THAT NEED MORE REGION SPACE -> ITS NOT FIND IT -> ABEND ->  S822 - REGION SPACE NOT ENOUGH

				S822 -> REGION=0M  - TO TELL THE SYSTEM TO ALLOCATE THE REQUIRED REGION SPACE..

					99% IT WIL FIX THE ISSUE... 
					1% --- STORAGE SPACE IS ITSELF NOT AVAIBALE --> CONTACT THE STORAGE TEAM - THEY WIL FIX IT

		5. PRTY =>  USED TO INCREAE  THE PRTY OF THE JOB...
			
			JOB J1 -> SUB		10AM
			JOB J2 -> SUB		10AM

				WHICH JOB WIL RUN FIRST ?  -> BOTH WIL RUN IN SAME TIME -> MAINFRAME CAN EXECUTION ALL DIFF JOB AT SAME TIME

			JOB J1 -> SUB		10AM	-- FILE1 - LOCK
			JOB J2 -> SUB		10AM	-- FILE1 - LOCK

				PRTY = JOB J1 /J2 WIL GET THE RESOUECE..

			SCHEULER TOOL - TO SET THE TIME LINE , DEPENDENCY.. 
		
		6. MSGCLASS=A/2/C  -> USED TO TELL WHERE THE LOGS NEED TO BE PRINTED
		
			//SYSOUT  DD SYSOUT=*		-> SPOOL
			//SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=*		-> SPOOL

			  SPOOL , PRINTER , TOOL 	1. ARCHIVE , 2. ABEND  3. REPORT

		MSGCLASS=X  -> SPOOL , PRINTER**		//SYSOUT  DD SYSOUT=*	DEFAULT OF MSGCLASS
		MSGCLASS=Y  -> SPOOL** , ARCHIVE TOOL		//SYSOUT  DD SYSOUT=*	- SPOOL

		JOB WITH NO MSGCLASS -->  //SYSOUT  DD SYSOUT=* --?  SPOOL??  PRINTER!!

		//IBMUSERX JOB NOTIFY=&SYSUID		= AFTER SOME TIME -> MANAGE CALL - INVOIVE TEAM -> PRINT THE LOG ON OUR PRINTER..

		7. MSGLEVEL=(STATMENT,MESSAGE)  = USED TO TELL WHAT LOGS NEED TO BE PRINTED

					USE - MSGLEVEL=(1,1) 	= BY DEFAULT AS WELL

			SUBMIT -.	SPOOL		JESMSGLG -- JOB START - END TIME
							JESJCL	 -- JOB STATEMENT
							JESYSMSG -- RUNNING JOB STEP MESSAGE
			

			STATEMENT	0	-- JOB
					1	-- JOB + EXEC + DD + PROC**	MAXIMUM
					2	-- JOB + EXEC + DD

			MESSAGE		0	-- STEP START-END TIME
					1	--- START-STOP TIME -- RUNNING ALLOCATION ,CAT,PASS.. MESSAGE	= MAXIMUM

		8. RESTART=STEPNAME

			USED TO RUN A JOB FROM A PARTICULAR STEPS..
			ANY JOB THAT IS SUBMMITED WILL RUN FROM FIRST STEPS..

	//JOB J1	1ST RUN					2ND RUN,RESTART=S3
	//S1		FINE						SKIP		
	//S2		FINE						SKIP
	//S3		FAILED/S322	FIX THE ISSUE			EXECUTE
		


//IBMUSERX JOB NOTIFY=&SYSUID

//IBMUSERX  JOB (089098,28902),'TEST JOB',CLASS=A,MSGCLASS=A,MSGLEVEL=(1,1),
//		TIME=10,REGION=0M,PRTY=10,
//		RESTART=STEPNAME,
//		NOTIFY=&SYSUID

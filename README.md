Watch out for any host addresses - make sure to set VSCode and TSO addresses to 204.90.115.200, instead of 192.86.32.250.



The COBOL course environment was previously hosted in a different IBM z/OS virtual machine - there may still be references in some documentation (usually in images/screenshots) that refer to the IP Address of that system (192.86.32.250) -- whenever required, replace this address with the IBM Z XPlore system address (204.90.115.200)



If you have joined through the IBM Learning platform (video course), or Coursera, you should use the course structure and materials provided on that platform to work through the course, but you can use the COBOL Courses forum on the IBM Z Xplore homepage.

Z system login not working? Request a new password

Your current Z user account is: Z54463

 and password: EAR89MUG

ðŸš¨ Are you sure you would you like to reset your password? ðŸš¨

 

Only do this if you:
1. Have lost, forgotten, or need a new password
2. Did not get a userid/password when you signed up.

Note: Passwords only last for 60 days
after that you will need to reset again. 

When your password expires, you may see an error like this in VS Code

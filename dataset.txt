Data Set Naming Rules:
=========================
1. A data set name consists of one or more parts connected by periods.Each part is called 
   a qualifier.For example MY.PROD.FILE.Here MY PROD and File are called the qualifiers
2. The first Qualifier is called the High Level Qualifier and the last is called the low level Qualifier
3. Each Qualifier must have 1-8 characters.
4. Alphabets,numeric,hyphen(-) and special characters(@#$) are allowed.
5. The maximum size of a data set name is 44 characters,including the periods.
6. You can use as many qualifiers as will fit within the 44 character overall size limitation
7.Data set name should not end with a period


TYPES OF DATASETS ON MAINFRAMES
=================================
1. PS-  SEQUENTIAL DATASET--(
2. PDS- PARTITIONED DATASET
3. Generation Data Set--(Maximum no of genearations(255))
4. PDS Extended
5. VSAM Datasets


Block size= no of records * record length;
Tota no of bytes = PQ +(SQ*15)
Directory Blocks in PDS = (N*6)-1



TO COPY A DATASET FROM ONE PS TO ANOTHER PS
==============================================
1.PS1 TO PS2. If PS2 contains data , PS1 data will be apended to PS2
2. TO Copy a dataset option 3.3 in ISPF Panel

TO COPY A DATASET FROM ONE PS TO PDS
=======================================
1. Either you can copy to new member or if you want to copy in the existing member you need to select option 
   replace so the entire data in the member is replaced by the ps1 data.


TO COPY A DATASET FROM ONE PDS TO PS
=======================================
1.PDS TO PS1. If PS1 contains data , PDS data will be apended to PS1.

TYPES OF DATASETS ON MAINFRAMES
=================================

NON-VSAM DATASETS-
1. PS-  SEQUENTIAL DATASET/Flat File/ Physical sequential/Transaction File
2. PDS- PARTITIONED DATASET
Generation Data Set--(Maximum no of genearations(255))
PDS Extended
VSAM Datasets-- ESDS,KSDS,RRDS,LDS


Data Set Naming Rules:
=========================
1. A data set name consists of one or more parts connected by periods.Each part is called 
   a qualifier.For example MY.PROD.FILE.Here MY PROD and File are called the qualifiers.
2. The first Qualifier is called the High Level Qualifier and the last is called the low level Qualifier
3. Each Qualifier must have 1-8 characters. and total qualifiers are 5
4. Alphabets,numeric,hyphen(-) and special characters(@#$) are allowed.
5. The maximum size of a data set name is 44 characters,including the periods.
6. Length of dataset Name
   -You can use as many qualifiers as will fit within the 44 character overall size limitation
7.Data set name should not end with a period

Ex:
VENKATB.DEMO.PS1----VALID
Length of Datset-16
How many qualifiers: 3(Venkat, Demo, Ps1)
High level Qualifiers: VENKATB
Low-level Qualifiers: PS1

Ex:

$ABC.RAC----VALID
1ABC.RAC----INVALID
ABC1.RAC1----VALID
A1B.C2#-------VALID

FIELDS: PNO,PNAME,PLOCATION,PPHN,PEMAILID
PARAMETERS
   VOLUME

   PRIMARY QUANTITY:    7500
   SECONDARY QUANTITY:
   DIRECTORY:- U want to create a ps file then specify 0
               you want to create a pds then specify value >=1
   RECORD LENGTH:      75
   BLOCK SIZE :   Block size is always multiple of record length
                  LRECL=75,BLKSIZE=150-- In a block i can stroe 2 records
                  LRECL=50,BLKSIZE=400---In each block how many records i can store: 8
                   LRECL=50,BLKSIZE=200---In each block how many records i can store: 4
   RECORD FORMAT:  FB
   ORGANIZATION TYPE:
                      BLANK IF you creating PS File
                      PDS if you creating PDS File

Note:
=====
Block size= no of records * record length;
Tota no of bytes = PQ +(SQ*15)
Directory Blocks in PDS = (N*6)-1
